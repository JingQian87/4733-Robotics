**Q1. (a)**



**Q1. (b)**



**Q2** 对于建筑模型选择，Sect. 4B描述了机器人选择通过距离和视角测试的最接近模型的过程。既然我们不希望模型太近或太远，那么选择这个范围中间的模型而不是最接近的模型会是一个很好的设计选择吗？

No, among all models that already pass a distance and viewing angle test, choosing a model in the middle of the range instead of the closest is not a good design choice. Since the models already pass the distance test, they are neither too close nor too far, which means they provide both enough and accurate visible features on the image. We don't need to worry that there might not be enough visible features on the image. Then we would want to maximize the features with the fixed camera resolution. So we choose the closest model to get the most accurate result.



**Q3. (a)** 作者的RANSAC实现使用最少数量的三个匹配的段对进行姿态估计。使用超过三对会有任何好处或缺点吗？

There are both benefits and drawbacks using more than three pairs. 

**Drawbacks**: it is more computational complex to use more than three pairs. More information to consider and more equations to solve.

**Benefits**: Using more than three pairs would provide more information, which could help us when facing multiple solutions. Often, we use more than three pairs when we have much measurement noise.



**Q3. (b)**一旦找到姿势，作者就使用匹配边的共识集上的覆盖度量来评估它。如果我们使用仅从单个阈值（例如，初始“大”值）找到的共识集，则简要地描述（在高水平）我们期望用姿势估计发生的事情。如果我们使用除以总投影长度的标准化程序 - 会低估正确的姿势会是一个问题怎么办？

1) If we use the consensus set found only from a single threshold, we may fail to get an accurate matching. We initialize the consensus threshold with a large value to make sure to generate a roughly correct consensus set initially. Then through decreasing the threshold, we gradually eliminate the false positives and increase the accuracy. If we use the initial "large" value, the false positives may always be allowed, and we may not improve the accuracy.

2) It is better that we do not use the normalization procedure of dividing by the total projected length, which tends to underrate the correct poses when the model is slightly outside of the field of view. When evaluating the pose candidates, we accept the one with the highest metric scores after the loop as the correct pose. So we don't want to raise a high standard and disqualify possible poses. On the other hand, if we overrate the poses, we could use criteria in the paper to eliminate unlikely ones. But it is hard to add eliminated poses after we underrate them.



**Q4** 图18示出了匹配失败的示例。查找并拍摄校园内另一栋建筑立面图片。虽然您没有机器人和摄像机参数，但尝试复制机器人的视角与其他图形类似（例如，不要只是在两个相同窗口的图片上一直放大）。简要解释为什么您的图像也会出现问题。

In the figure above, I showed a building facade on campus where the matching may fail. I tried to replicate the robot’s perspective as that in other figures in the paper. It is hard for the robot to match the image and the model due to the high degree of repetitiveness in the features. The windows in a row are identical.  Specifically speaking, the robot may mistake point A to point B or C.
